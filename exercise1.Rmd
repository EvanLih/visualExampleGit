# This is notebook
## Edited by: Evan Lih



This is how you write in italics: *this way* or _this way_.
This is how you write in bold: **this way** or __this way__.

If you need bullets:

* One bullet
* another one.

This is where you add a small piece of R code:


```{r}
1+10
library(citr)
```

You will write several of those pieces later.

Finally, you can add a citation using **citr** after the word "work":

All this work will be based on previous work.
